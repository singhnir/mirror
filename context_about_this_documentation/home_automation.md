## Home automation
Home automation has been around for a long time and it is all about turning the house into an intelligent unit with the goal of increasing comfort and efficiency at home. Some of the typical applications are automatic lights, intelligent thermostats, alarms, window blinds.

In my project I am focusing on home automation since I have access to smart home devices. However it would be very easy to write an application to turn on and off the lights using voice commands or gestures on the mirror or even an application to change the temperature of the room, for example. These examples are just the tip of the iceberg as there are new connected devices emerging everyday that could interact with the mirror.
