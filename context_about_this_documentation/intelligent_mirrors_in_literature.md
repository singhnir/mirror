### Intelligent Mirrors in literature

1. Daniel Besserer et al. (2016) created a smart mirror for adding interactive fitness exercises to a personâ€™s morning routine. Their project utilizes the Microsoft Kinect v2 for tracking gestures and a Wii Balance Board for presence detection

2. Chidambaram Sethukkarasi et al. (2016) created an intelligent mirror that identifies users based on facial recognition, recognizes emotions, records health parameters and gives clothing advise.

3. The most intelligent of the smart mirror projects is likely to be the research project Semeoticons. Its purpose is to analyze facial signs to measure the health level of the person in front of it. The paper by Franco Chiarugi et al. (2013) discusses the motivation and rationale behind the project.
