## Internet of Things
The Internet of Things is a concept defined as a network of connected physical objects. Itâ€™s often viewed as the next step for the internet. Recently it has gained a lot of popularity predicting that in the future most everyday objects will be connected to each other and will be able to interact in smart ways. The Smart Mirror will eventually become one of these connected objects in our households and if we think about it being able to communicate with other objects the possibilities become endless. Using IoT for home automation has many real-world applications, for example, we can build a smart home which will automatically close or open the windows based on the weather conditions outside.
