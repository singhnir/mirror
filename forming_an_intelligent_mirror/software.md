## Software
I use Linux based operating system RASBIAN ARM v 7 and for intelligent mirror follow the MichMich magic mirror 2 java script. The open source software that powers the mirror, MagicMirror2, is still currently in development and it was completely rebuilt in March 2016 using Electron, the same tool that I used for my own project. MagicMirror2 supports small widgets called “modules” and anyone can write one. The default installation comes with some basic widgets for time, calendar, weather and news and there are about 30 third party modules available.

    6.3.1. Install Raspbian
    6.3.2. Install MagicMirror and dependencies
    6.3.3. Configuring the Raspberry Pi
