# Forming an Intelligent Mirror
This project also involves actually building an intelligent mirror. To be precise, the intelligent part is supplied by the software. The actual physical device built would more correctly be coined a smart mirror according to the distinction between smart and intelligent mirrors made during the introduction. There are many properties to be considered when building the mirror: weight, mirror size, screen size, hardware selection, power supply, mounting technique, heat generation, and aesthetics. This section will explain many of the choices to be made for building a smart mirror, the options available, and why the final choices were made.
