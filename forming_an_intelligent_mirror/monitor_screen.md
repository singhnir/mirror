### Monitor screen
There are three main possibilities in the choice of screen selection: laptop replacement screen, desktop monitor or a usb-powered monitor. Each have their pros and cons listed in table.

| Screen-type | Pros | Cons |
| -- | -- | -- |
| Replacement screen| Thin, Light & Cheap | Requires additional controller board for video signal and power often less than 16" |
| Desktop monitor | 24" and up integrated power supply integrated video signal | Heavy & Expensive |
| USB- powered | Thin, light & no need for external power video and power in one cable | Expensive Compatibility issues with linux systems |

So for the display we recycled 24 inch TFT screen from old monitor. In which there was a power cable to power the screen and VGA female for video input.
