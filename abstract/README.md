This project has been developed within the context of a time where every day we see more and more connected devices. The Internet transformed our lives by connecting us more easily to information and other people in the virtual world. Mobile phones then became smartphones and since then this concept has erupted and morphed into the Internet of Things, things which connect us to everyday objects. There are no end of objects that could be made “smarter”, some being more suited to this than others. Mirrors, for example, provide a large surface ideal for displaying information and interacting with. Most people have mirrors at home so the concept of a smart mirror that you can interact with is attractive and has been fantasized in many futuristic movies.

In this project, I demonstrate the function and working of a smart home mirror. The mirror will possess the ability to display date and time, the current weather condition and outside temperature, reminders, to-do lists and traffic conditions. These features of the mirror will be scraped from the Internet and implemented using the raspberry pi board. The pi board is programmed with the Raspbian operating system which is part of Linux. The mirror will also be lightweight, adjustable, durable and aesthetic. This paper presents the implementation and application of the smart mirror and how it is an integral part of home automation.
