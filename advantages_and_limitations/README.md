# Advantages and limitations
The result of this intelligent mirror is a super clean and simple piece of tech that not only integrates quietly into the background of an otherwise normal household item, but also provides relevant information when it’s needed. It perfectly augments the functionality of the bathroom, while not hindering its user with a whole bunch of cluttered buttons and annoying sound alerts. In other words, it’s technology from the movies brought to life. It’s cool. It’s stylish. It’s simple. But don’t look at what’s behind it. That’s where all the circuitry, wires and components are stored, and that part of the system… isn’t quite ready for its close-up. Yet.
