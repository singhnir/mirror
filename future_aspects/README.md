# Future aspects
Sci-Fi books and futuristic movies have been hinting at the possibility of a smart mirror for quite a while. With the recent boom of the smartphone, this reality seemed closer with each passing year. The technology seemed to be available, yet the only thing missing was application.

The topic of intelligent mirrors is a huge topic. Future work could aim to implement any of the unused scenarios, such as adding gesture control, finger print scanner, communicating with the mirror by voice or integrating the intelligent mirror into an already existing smart home economy.

In future this mirror can be used to build smart home network with devices such as lights, virtual assistant, TV, music system, refrigerators, etc. can be integrated together. This would lead to real smart home.
